Argentina, which was temporarily unclassified in July 2016 pending release of revised national accounts statistics, is classified as upper middle income for FY17 as of September 29, 2016.

The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. In the case of Argentina, the World Bank has found that during 2012-2015 there were two exchange rates (official and parallel) and parallel exchange rate (blue chip swap rate) was used in around 20% of the transactions. Based on this information an alternative conversion factor has been calculated using a weighted average method for this period.",G,PERCENT,G
